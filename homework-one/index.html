<h2 class="steeping-methods">Steeping Methods</h2>
<p class="methods">In order to get a proper steep on your new teas, lets walk through the two tea-making methods!</p>
<div class="hottea">
<p class="hot">First, we have HOT TEA. Hot tea takes anywhere from 4-7 minutes and it's the most simple method to made delicous tea! Simple take out a sachet from your tea tin, place in hot water, drape the string over the outside of the cup, and wait! In just a few minutes you will have perfectly steeped hot tea.</p>
</div>
<div class="coldtea">
  <p class="cold">Second, we have ICED TEA. Iced tea takes a bit more work, but worry not. Iced tea just takes one extra step. To make this form of tea, simply follow the instructions for hot tea, except add double the amount of tea to the hot water. Once you wait for the tea to finish steeping, you will pour it over ice! Simply as that, you have made iced tea. Sip and savor!</p>
